# Flight Simulator
This is a flight simulator written in C++ with OpenGL. I created this projected to learn more about graphic programming.

## Techniques used in this project
- Terrain generation with diamond-square algorithm
- Splat maps
- Diffuse lighting
- Normal mapping

## To add
- Shadows using depth buffer
- Displacement maps
- Post processing shader
- Particle system
- Sky box (using cube map)

## Disclaimer
- None of the 3d models were modelled by me
- Some textures were not created by me
